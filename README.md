# Mosque-Aisha-Website
Contains html, css, js, and image files for the Mosque Aisha Website.

This website is being developed for the Mosque Aisha Community in Niagara Falls. It is currently work in progress.

For this project, I have created the overall layout and template design for the webpage. The images and information were provided by the Mosque Aisha Staff.
I would like to continue putting more images and details on the other subpages (i.e. 'Events', 'News', etc.)

One of the main focuses for this webpage was interactivity. Javascript was used to create smooth animations for components such as menus and image carousels.

I am open to all feedback on the webpage both fron a design aspect as well as coding perspective. Thank you!
